Tactical Intervention: Red Mountain is a fully realized version of the project that kickstarted the development of custom weapons for TacRP: Gestalt Interops. 

In early 2023, VinierAardvark1 had the idea to backport content from TacRP to the original Tactical Intervention weapons from which TacRP was dervied and add entirely new content in the process. This caught 8Z's attention and prompted him to overhaul TacRP and port forward our custom content. We eventually ceased development on Gestalt Interops and fully turned our attention to TacRP.

This is that abandoned project, polished up for an official release and with a couple of weapons we've since made for TacRP backported.
